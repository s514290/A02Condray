			<div class = "mainText">
				My name is Chester Condray and I am from Farmington, Missouri. I went to highschool at<br>
				Arcadia Valley R-II and also attended two years at Mineral Area College in Park Hills. I<br>
				am a computer science major at Northwest Missouri State University in my Senior year and<br>
				am looking forward to graduating in December of 2017. I unfortunately don't have very much<br>
				of a work history, but am very optimistic.

			<h3 class = "headerColor">Plans For the Future:</h3>
			<div class = "mainText">
				I'm not currently settled on future plans right now, but I do have several things I<br>
				would like to try and go into. I'm currently considering work in Data Entry at a place<br>
				close to home with a company called Centene. They handle insurance claims and are intending<br>
				to expand while moving to a new, larger site so I'm considering getting in with them as<br>
				they grow. The other path I'm considering is doing networking, but where I might do that<br>
				I have not mapped out yet so that option is still in the research phase.

			<h3 class = "headerColor">My Interests:</h3>
			<div class = "mainText">
				My biggest hobby currently is in video games, no big surprise there. They're a good way<br>
				to relax and for me they can actually help sometimes with my own creative processes. I also<br>
				do some exercising, I'm actually on a nine week cardio program to help get e going. I don't<br>
				really have very much interest in sports, but I am fond of baseball since my parents used to<br>
				take my siblings and I to see Cardinals games while we lived in St. Louis. I also find boxing<br>
				to be interesting but have not kept up with it recently.<br>
				<br>
				Also love GMod and SFM videos.<br>
